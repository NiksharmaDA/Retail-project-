---5. Looking at July 2021 data, what do you think is our biggest problem and how would you recommend fixing it ?

---How much order rejected 

select year(creation_time) as Year, Count(*) as Total_Rejected_Orders from sales_orders
where sales_order_status = 'Rejected'
group by year(creation_time)



---So Our biggest problem in 2021 was our app proformance because less customers login on app and conversion of orders are also less in 2021.


---6. Does the login frequency affect the number of orders made?

select year, sum(Total_Orders_Each_day) as Total_Orders_Each_year from Conversion_Rate_from_Login_to_Orders_Per_Day
group by YEar

---D

select year, sum([No. of Visit per_day]) as [No. of Visit per_year]  from daily_logins
group by Year

---Answer = So after analysing both year's Total Login count and total Orders Count, it is clearly visible that 
---			login frequency affect our no. of orders made.


---7. Give at least 2 insights that are not mentioned above and are not clearly visible from the data.

--- Answer 

---A. The depot id 1,8,9 are rejected most no. of orders. 

select fk_depot_id , Count(*) as Total_Rejected_in_each_depot from
(select fk_depot_id, sales_Order_status from sales_orders
where sales_order_status = 'Rejected') as a 
group by fk_depot_id
order by Total_Rejected_in_each_depot desc

---B.So out of Total_order_quantity of 66638 only 29786 Total_order_quantity were accpted. 

select Sum(ordered_quantity) as Total_Order_Placed, Sum(Order_Quantity_Accepted) as Total_Order_Accepted from sales_orders_items

---C-Around 7,09,10,364 Rs loss faced by company due to rejected orders. 

select sum(rate) as Total_loss from sales_orders_items
where order_quantity_accepted = 0

select  datepart(DAY, creation_time) as Time , count(*) as Orders from sales_orders
group by datepart(DAY, creation_time)
order by Time

---D-On which day orders gets less orders 


select DateName(Weekday,creation_time) as Day, Count(*) as Rejected_Each_Day from sales_orders
group by DateName(Weekday,creation_time)
order by Rejected_Each_Day desc
